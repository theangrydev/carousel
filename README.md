To get the SCSS compile to work:
1. Download Ruby from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
2. Run 'Start Command Prompt with Ruby' that should have been installed
3. At that prompt run 'gem install sass'
4. Change into the project directory, so that scss and css are direct subfolders
5. Run '<Ruby Install Directory>\bin\scss.bat --no-cache --update scss\style.scss:css\style.css' to compile
